\opening{Dear Mr/Ms recruiter:}



I'm writing to express my interest in the recently advertised role of "Firmware Development Engineer" for the Valencia'a area. I believe I could bring valuable skills and experience to Analog Devices Valencia that would make me an ideal fit for this position.

I have more than 10 years of experience as a SW / FW engineer and at this moment I have worked in such different areas as R\&D and industry and in sectors such as bioengineering, artificial vision, virtual reality, image processing, natural interfaces, design of new products, certification tests, production tests and a long etcetera that provide me with a great experience for the position.

More specifically and regarding the job, I have experience in the design, development and testing of SW / FW for medical, maritime, aerospace and communications products of clients such as Roche, Biomerieux, Daktari Diagnostics, Thales, Utas, Inmarsat, Kongsberg / Simrad, etc.

On the other hand, my experience in the university like a R\&D engineer (with some works and studies around the healthcare area) provides me with a great overview and skills to meet the requirements of the position.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application, and I look forward to hearing from you.


\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
